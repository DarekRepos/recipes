    "description": "For instance, in the hill-side areas, where oats were mainly cultivated, oat flour was largely used in the daily diet. In the cookery of the Kaszuby area, fish constituted a significant part, as did geese for the inhabitants of the Pomorze area. Inhe regions to the east of the Vistula, a typical dish was baked pierogi. These were stuffed with potatoes, cheese, cabbage, mushrooms, buckwheat and millet. This was also true of boiled pierogi which are eaten throughout Poland today. It should be said that in the Pomorze, Podlasie and Wielkopolska regions, this dish only became popular in the inter-war period. Considerably later, after the second World War, pierogi were served in the Warmia and Mazury regions.",
