    "description": "Traditional cooking in the Zolkiewski region is part of Ukainian cookery, rich in different tastes and products. It is based on breads and dishes made predominantly of flour and grains. Meat, vegetables and fish also play a significant part. Bread, sometimes baked in special ovens, also plays a part in ceremonies, particularly the so-called korowaj. There are numerous dishes made of boiled pastry- warenyky with various stuffings: curd che - ese, potatoes, morello cherries. The famous and very popular “pierogi ruskie” are part of this group, filled with curd cheese (as a sweet dish with added raisins) or potatoes (as a savoury dish) or with potatoes and curd cheese. Another variety of “pierogi” - pielmieni- also eaten in the Ukraine, have probably been borrowed from Russian cookery.",
