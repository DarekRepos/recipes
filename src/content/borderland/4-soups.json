    "description": "Apart from the previously mentioned pierogi, Leczynski cookery was characterised by its variety of soups. Soup was, in essence, an all-day meal. It was eaten in the morning, afternoon and evening. A traditional soup was based on ingredients of low nutritional value. Meals on peasants’ tables were based on flour and potatoes. Their names - „lemieszka” or„prazucha”remain somewhat surprising to this day. It is true that the regional cookery is „poor people’s cookery” but it is also true that in this region, „estate cookery” developed, considerably richer in its culinary possibilities. In preparing estate dishes, many vegetables and fruit were used and these were prepared in a variety of ways. A popular estate cookery dish was the so-called „golabki”, or buckwheat, rice or meat rolled in cabbage leaves as well as „pancakes”, called „dziady” made from sugar beets. They were made on All Saints Day and given to beggars outside the churches.",
