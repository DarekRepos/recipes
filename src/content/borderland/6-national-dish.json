    "description": "The national dish in this region is the Ukrainian Barszcz. This is most often served as a clear soup with the addition of specific vegetables (beans) a spoonful of sour cream and a yeast pastry. Barszcz can vary greatly in taste: from a vegetable type to a meat type and one made of fish stock. Preparing Ukrainian Barszcz is treated as a type of test. They say that one can tell from the barszcz whether there is a good housewife in a given house. Other popular soups inclu - de kapusnjak (sauerkraut soup) and juszka. Beef, pork, mutton and poultry are eaten. The favourite national meal is pork fat- prepared in numerous ways - salted, smoked, braised and sweet (as desserts). Pork fat is usually eaten with bread and mustard (traditional va - rieties are Czarcia and Kozacka) or with potatoes. It is added (usually fried) to almost all savoury dishes (soups and main meals) and as stuffing for other meats to increase the moistness. Among the drinks, “kwas” should be mentioned, sometimes served with berries or with added birch juice. There are also numerous varieties of wines, beers and vodkas",
