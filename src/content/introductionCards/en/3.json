  "description": "The cuisine of the Kresy region is shaped by diversity — cultural, geographical, and historical. Influences from Polish, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, and Jewish traditions blend together to form a rich and distinctive culinary identity. Aromatic soups, hearty dumplings, fermented ingredients, and slow-cooked dishes reflect both the harsh climate and the warmth of local hospitality.",
