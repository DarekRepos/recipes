## Cebularz (Onion Tarts)

Mix the fresh yeast with the sugar and add 2 tablespoons of warm milk. Add 3 tablespoons of flour. Leave this prepared leaven to rise for 15 minutes or so. (Cover with a linen cloth.) Once the leaven has risen, add the flour, egg, and milk. Mix well. Add the salt. Knead until the consistency of the dough is even. Continue to knead until small air bubbles appear in the dough. Add the oil or melted margarine and mix well. Leave the dough for 15 minutes to rise. In the meantime, prepare the baking tins and peel and chop the onions, add salt and fry lightly till golden. Add the poppy seeds and mix. Divide the risen dough into three pieces. Roll out each piece to a thickness of about 1 cm. Using the rim of a large glass, press out circles of dough and stretch these gently to the required size (for the tart bases) and place in the baking tray. Put the onion and poppy seed mixture on top of the dough rounds. Place the tray in a well-heated oven and bake for 15-20 minutes until golden.
