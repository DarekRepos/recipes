## Golabki

Cut out the cabbage core, scald the cabbage, and separate the leaves. Boil the rice adding salt and 3 tablespoons of oil to prevent the rice from sticking. Wrap the pan containing rice in a blanket and leave to steam. Chop the onions and mushrooms and fry in oil. Allow to cool. Add the meat, season and mix. Pare the central cabbage stalks. Place stuffing on each leaf and wrap in the cabbage leaf. Line a deep baking tray with remaining cabbage leaves and place the golabki tightly on it, 2-3 layers deep.

### Tomato Sauce
Boil the water with the spices and add the tomato concentrate. Blend the flour with the sour cream, add a little hot water, mix well and add to the tomato mixture. Simmer until the liquid thickens. Pour the liquid onto the golabki in the baking tray and cover. Bake in a medium oven for about 1 hour. After 40 minutes in the oven, remove the lid.
