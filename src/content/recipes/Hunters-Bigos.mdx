## Hunters’ Bigos

### Instructions:
1. Pour a small amount of boiling stock or water over the sauerkraut.
2. Add rinds from smoked or unsmoked pork fat and the bacon to the sauerkraut. Boil uncovered for about an hour.
3. Soak the dried mushrooms overnight and boil them. Cut into small strips and add to the sauerkraut with the mushroom stock.
4. Cut the meat into fairly large cubes and add to the sauerkraut mixture.
5. Add the fat. Remove the rinds and bacon that have been cooking with the sauerkraut, cut the bacon into small cubes, and return to the pan.
6. Remove the skin from the Polish sausage, slice it, and add to the pan.
7. Mix all ingredients and allow them to simmer.
8. Add the bay leaf and pimentos.
9. Fry the onion in the pork fat, add the flour, and cook until browned to make a roux. Add this roux to the bigos before serving.
