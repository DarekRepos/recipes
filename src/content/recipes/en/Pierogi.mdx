## Pierogi

### Pastry:

Add all the ingredients to form a soft dough. Roll out the pastry to a thickness of a few millimetres. Using the rim of a glass, cut out rounds onto which the various stuffings can be placed.

### Stuffing 1: Buckwheat and Cheese

Sift the buckwheat for impurities. Add to salted, boiling water. Boil for a few minutes. Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. Wrap the pan with buckwheat in a blanket and allow to steam. Remove buckwheat and allow to cool. Add other ingredients and mix well. Season to taste. Fill the pierogi. These are served hot with sour cream or butter or skwarki (types of fried “lardons” made with fat only). They can also be served fried to a golden colour.

### Stuffing 2: Potatoes

Wash, peel, and grate the potatoes on a medium grater. Squeeze out the potato water, add the eggs, seasoning, and the onion – previously chopped finely and fried to a golden colour. Thicken the stuffing with flour or semolina. Fill the pierogi. These can also be served fried.

### Stuffing 3: Lentils and Meat

Boil the lentils until soft (as with peas or beans). After they have cooled, put through a mincer and add the minced meat, a little salt and pepper, as well as fried onion. Mix well. Fill the pierogi and boil. Serve with fried lardons.
