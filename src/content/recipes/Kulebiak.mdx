## General Kicki’s Wife’s Pasty (Kulebiak)

Boil the dressed chicken with the vegetables until the meat is soft. Remove chicken and allow to cool. Remove flesh from carcass and mince together with vegetables. Add eggs and bread roll (previously soaked and squeezed to remove excess water). Season to taste. Mix the yeast, milk, and sugar and leave for 10 mins until the yeast has risen. Mix the remaining ingredients with the flour and the yeast mixture. Mix well. Work the dough until it is smooth. Add the clarified butter and work dough again. Leave to rise. When risen, divide the dough into two halves. Roll out each half to form a square. Place half the stuffing in the center of each half of dough, spread slightly, fold dough over the stuffing, stick edges together. Place in baking trays. The tops of the pasties may be glazed with a small amount of beaten egg. Place in a hot oven. Cook for 40-50 mins at a temperature of 180-200°C.
