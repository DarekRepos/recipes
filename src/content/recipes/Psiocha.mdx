## Psiocha from Lemieszko

### Instructions:
Boil the peeled potatoes in salted water. Leaving the water in the pan, sprinkle the flour into the potatoes, cover the pan and allow the mixture to steam for 5 minutes. Once the contents no longer have an uncooked aroma, spoon out onto plates in small mounds. Add “lardons” or onions, fried to a golden colour. If the flour is browned first, the lemieszka takes on a different colour and taste. That is also served with “lardons” or onions. Both the white and brown lemieszka can be served the following day, cut into pieces or sliced and then fried until golden. No “lardons” or onions are then served. Both types of lemieszka are best served with natural yoghurt.

## Ingredients

### Serves about 5:
- **2 kg** potatoes
- **25 dag** wheat flour
- **1** onion
- **10 dag** pork fat
