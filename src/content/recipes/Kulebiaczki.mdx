## Pasties (Kulebiaczki)

Mix the yeast with the sugar. With remaining ingredients make the dough. Boil the sauerkraut until soft. Squeeze excess fluid out. Finely chop the onion and mushrooms and fry gently in oil until soft. If using dried mushrooms, these should be previously soaked, boiled, and cut into small strips. Season the cabbage stuffing. Roll out the dough to a 1 cm thickness. Using an upturned glass, cut out dough circles, fill with stuffing and stick dough down into a pasty shape. Brush pasties with beaten egg. Bake for 40-50 mins in a medium oven.
